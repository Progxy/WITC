# WITC: What's in the Code?

The following is a small machine code to asm decoder library.
For more information see the `Roadmap` below.

> [!WARNING]
> Note that the following is under "active" development (take that into consideration).

## Roadmap:
 - [ ] Add support for all AMD64 mnemonics;
 - [ ] Add support for instructions fields for better instruction decoding;
 - [ ] Add support for binary file decoding;
 - [ ] Add support for all Intel mnemonics (switch decoding architecture using flags);
 - [ ] Add support for all ARM mnemonics;
 - [ ] Fancy features (to be expanded upon later).
